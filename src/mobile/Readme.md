## Notes
> Added ip-config.js (running separately in npm start) which is updating IP in config.json (used in axios.js to connect to server)

## Tasks
> [ ] Use better approach to ensure same padding and status bar visibility in all screens

> [x] Automate updating server IP when network is changed for packager host, where server should be running
